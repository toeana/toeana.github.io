            Puffball mushrooms can range in size, averaging from 10-70 cm in diameter. They have a spongy texture and
            when squished, they release a ‘puff’ of air.

          Puffball mushroom is a general term but there are 32 sub-species. Puffball mushrooms are the only mushroom to
          fully contain spores inside the body. The most common species is the Giant Puffball and is favored for its
          large size and mild flavor. The Giant Puffball is known for its large size and the largest one recorded was
          over 50 pounds.<br>This mushroom is best prepared pan-fried or sautéed. Puffball mushrooms pair best with
          egg dishes with garlic and butter. They also pair well with vegetables such as broccoli, eggplant, and beets,
          as well as meat and poultry.
