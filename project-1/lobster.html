          Lobster mushrooms are technically not a mushroom despite the word being in the name. They are a fungi that has
          been altered by a parasitic mold. Don’t let this deter you from wanting to eat this delicious mushroom!
          Lobster mushrooms are available in the fall through early winter as they thrive in the cold weather. Not only
          are these found in the Pacific Northwest, but they can also be found in New England where the temperature is
          equally as cold. When looking for this mushroom, make sure you are looking in the depths of the forest and
          look out for their bright orange color - it is nearly unmistakable!<br>When cooking this mushroom, they are
          best prepared sautéed or braised. The mushrooms retain their firmness when cooked, so they can also be mixed
          into pasta, chowders, and soups. Lobster mushrooms pair best with onions, garlic, ginger, potatoes, and lemon.
