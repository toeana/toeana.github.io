            best thrift store you can come across. Let your beloved stuff live again 
            and release it back into the wild at Village Merchants, your friendly, 
            neighborhood resale shop. 

            How it all works:
            Drop off your items with our helpful sales staff. Generally, we accept the 
            equivalent of ONE plastic bin or big, blue IKEA bag per day. You are 
            welcome to return with more items the following day. Bulkier items can be 
            considered outside of this size limit. You can email pictures of furniture
            and large items to villagepix@yahoo.com. ​We will create an account for you 
            and give a quick scan of your items to ensure they are things we generally 
            consider. We do not take unclean or broken merchandise. ​​
            
            Sell​
            Sell us your items outright and get paid the same day. We pay you 30% 
            of the marked retail price.
            
            Trade​
            We will trade you your stuff at 40% the marked retail price. This will be 
            added to your Trade Account and be available toward any item in the store. ​
            
            Consign​
            We take in and price your items for sale. Your Consignment Account will
            accrue value as your items are sold. You are able to withdraw cash from 
            your account every 28 days, however, these funds are immediately 
            available to use as trade credit. We credit your account on items sold at 
            the following rates:40% -- for sold items priced under 50 dollars. 50% -- 
            for items sold between 50 to 99 dollars. 60% -- for sold items priced at 
            100 dollars and above. ​We also will consign your original art and 
            handmade items made by you. We pay you 60% of the sales price for 
            these items, and would love to see what you have been making during lockdown. ​
