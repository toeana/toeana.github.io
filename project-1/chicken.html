          Chicken of the Woods are a medium to large in size and can grow up to nearly 1 foot in diameter. This mushroom
          got its name because when cooked, it is juicy and meaty with a mild lemon flavor reminiscent of chicken. This
          mushroom is a good meat substitute for those vegan and vegetarian folks. These mushrooms grow on the dead or
          dying trunks of hardwood trees such as oak, cherry, or beech. There are some that grow on eucalyptus or cedar,
          but avoid these at all costs because they can absorb oils from the trees that are known to cause intestinal
          irritation. This mushroom is known to primarily grow in hardwood forests along the West Coast and East Coast
          of the United States, as well as Europe.<br />This mushroom is a known meat substitute for chicken and is used
          in many vegetarian dishes. Chicken of the Woods is best prepared saut√©ed with herbs and butter or oil. Chicken
          of the Woods pairs well with garlic, onions, potatoes, wild rice, white wine, Monterey Jack cheese, and in
          risottos. In certain parts of the United States, Chicken of the Woods is considered a delicacy due to its
          poultry or seafood-like flavor. Traditionally, this mushroom has also been dried and made into a powder to use
          as a snuff.
