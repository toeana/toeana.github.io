          Morel mushrooms can be found growing near orchards or in meadows on disturbed ground near spruce or elm trees.
          Morel musrooms are hard to cultivate because they have delicate growing conditions and a short season, causing
          them to become very expensive in markets as they are difficult to find. Despite their rairty, Morel mushrooms
          are on of the most prized culinary possesions and are favored for their unsual shape, deep flavor, and of
          course, their rarity.<br>When cooked, Morels are meaty with a deep nutty and woodsy flavor. The best way to
          prepare these mushrooms is cooked in wine or in cream-based sauces. These mushrooms can be mixed into pasta or
          risotto but also fried to create a crispy bite. Morels can also be dried for an extended use and rehydrated
          when needed. They can keep for up to one year when dried.
