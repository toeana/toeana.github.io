  <h5>About Village Merchants</h5>
  <h6>Open for business seven days a week 11-6<br>
    Buying hours: Monday-Saturday 11-2 </h6>

  <p>Village Merchants is the best thrift store you can come across. Let your beloved 
    stuff live again<br> and release it back into the wild at Village Merchants, your friendly,<br>
    neighborhood resale shop.<br> 

    How it all works:<br>
    Drop off your items with our helpful sales staff. Generally, we accept the <br> 
    equivalent of ONE plastic bin or big, blue IKEA bag per day. You are <br>
    welcome to return with more items the following day. Bulkier items can be<br>
    considered outside of this size limit. You can email pictures of furniture<br>
    and large items to villagepix@yahoo.com. ​We will create an account for you<br> 
    and give a quick scan of your items to ensure they are things we generally<br>
    consider. We do not take unclean or broken merchandise. ​<br>
    
    Sell​<br>
    Sell us your items outright and get paid the same day. We pay you 30%<br> 
    of the marked retail price.<br>
    
    Trade​<br>
    We will trade you your stuff at 40% the marked retail price. This will be<br> 
    added to your Trade Account and be available toward any item in the store.<br>​
    
    Consign​<br>
    We take in and price your items for sale. Your Consignment Account will<br>
    accrue value as your items are sold. You are able to withdraw cash from<br> 
    your account every 28 days, however, these funds are immediately<br> 
    available to use as trade credit. We credit your account on items sold at<br> 
    the following rates:40% -- for sold items priced under 50 dollars. 50% -- <br>
    for items sold between 50 to 99 dollars. 60% -- for sold items priced at<br> 
    100 dollars and above. ​We also will consign your original art and <br>
    handmade items made by you. We pay you 60% of the sales price for<br> 
    these items, and would love to see what you have been making during lockdown. </p>
