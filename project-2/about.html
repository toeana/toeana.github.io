  <h5>About Village Merchants</h5>
  <h6>Open for business seven days a week 11-6<br>
    Buying hours: Monday-Saturday 11-2 </h6>

  <p>Village Merchants is the best thrift store you can come across. Let your beloved 
    stuff live again and release it back into the wild at Village Merchants, your friendly,
    neighborhood resale shop.<br> 

    <br><b>How it all works:</b><br>
    Drop off your items with our helpful sales staff. Generally, we accept the <br> 
    equivalent of ONE plastic bin or big, blue IKEA bag per day. You are <br>
    welcome to return with more items the following day. Bulkier items can be<br>
    considered outside of this size limit. You can email pictures of furniture<br>
    and large items to <b>villagepix@yahoo.com.</b> ​We will create an account for you 
    and give a quick scan of your items to ensure they are things we generally
    consider. We do not take unclean or broken merchandise. ​<br>
    
    <br><b>Sell</b>​<br>
    Sell us your items outright and get paid the same day. We pay you 30%<br> 
    of the marked retail price.<br>
    
    <br><b>Trade</b>​<br>
    We will trade you your stuff at 40% the marked retail price. This will be<br> 
    added to your Trade Account and be available toward any item in the store.<br>​
    
    <br><b>Consign</b>​<br>
    We take in and price your items for sale. Your Consignment Account will<br>
    accrue value as your items are sold. You are able to withdraw cash from<br> 
    your account every 28 days, however, these funds are immediately<br> 
    available to use as trade credit. We credit your account on items sold at<br> 
    the following rates:40% -- for sold items priced under 50 dollars. 50% -- <br>
    for items sold between 50 to 99 dollars. 60% -- for sold items priced at<br> 
    100 dollars and above. ​We also will consign your original art and <br>
    handmade items made by you. We pay you 60% of the sales price for<br> 
    these items, and would love to see what you have been making during lockdown. </p>
